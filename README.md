# pokemon-app 
It is an application developed in react, which makes many requests, I developed it with async/await, although there were some problems when trying to change the background but it was solved. On the other hand, it has some style flaws that I will fix soon, It was really amazing to develop this app, I will add more features as soon as I can.
## Development ðŸ§±
- You can see any pokemon, from anywhere and shiny pokemon are also integrated.
- For each type of pokemon there is a specific type of color, that is, if the pokemon is a fire type, the background will be a little orange.
- It has a search engine that can search for pokemon and by the way there are also 2 buttons that you can click to search for the next pokemon.
- In the status of the pokemon you can see: the name, the id number, the power, pp, the type of pokemon, the location where the pokemon can be found and a brief description of the pokemon.
- It has a generator of random tips, I used this to give a little color to the application.
